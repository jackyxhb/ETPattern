# English Thought (ET) Logo Guide

The English Thought identity leans into the idea of a thought bubble that encapsulates the 300 expression patterns learners practice in the app. The logo combines three visual metaphors:

1. **Speech & Thought** – A rounded square with a subtle tail evokes both a conversation bubble and a thought cloud, reinforcing the "English Thought" name.
2. **Orbiting Pattern Path** – The diagonal arc hints at the circular practice loops learners complete while reviewing patterns.
3. **ET Monogram** – A clean, geometric "ET" monogram sits in the center to keep the mark recognizable even at small sizes.

## Color Palette
- **Aurora Gradient**: #00C6FF → #0072FF to mirror the app's gradient backgrounds.
- **Night Ink**: #0F172A for the monogram, providing strong contrast.

## Usage Notes
- The SVG provided here is resolution-independent and can be exported as a single-symbol PDF for use inside `Assets.xcassets`.
- Leave ~12% padding around the mark when placing it on marketing material or inside splash screens.
- The default orientation is upright; avoid rotating the logo to preserve the arc/trajectory metaphor.
