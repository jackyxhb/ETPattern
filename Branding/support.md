## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. How do I import new flashcards?

You can easily import custom decks using our CSV import feature:

1. Tap the **Menu** button (top right corner).
2. Select **Import**.
3. Choose a properly formatted CSV file from your files.
   * **Format**: `Front;;Back;;Tags` (Double semicolon separator)
   * **Example**: `Hello;;Hola;;Greeting`

### 2. My progress isn't syncing between my iPhone and iPad

ETPattern uses **iCloud** to keep your data in sync. If you are experiencing issues:

* **Check iCloud**: Ensure you are signed in with the same Apple ID on both devices.
* **Enable iCloud Drive**: Go to iOS Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > iCloud Drive and ensure it is enabled.
* **Internet Connection**: Syncing requires an active internet connection.

### 3. I can't hear the audio/Text-to-Speech

* **Silent Mode**: Check if your device's physical silent switch is on.
* **In-App Settings**: Open the app **Settings** and ensure the **Volume** slider is turned up.
* **Voice Selection**: Try selecting a different voice in the Settings menu if the current one isn't working.

### 4. What do the different "Maturity" levels mean?

In the **Mastery Dashboard**, we categorize cards based on how well you know them:

* **New**: Cards you haven't studied yet.
* **Learning**: Cards you are currently studying but haven't fully memorized.
* **Mature**: Cards you have correctly recalled consistently over a long period.
